pretty-lectures
===============

Makes a certain professor's online lectures prettier!

Works with chrome, haven't tested it with other browsers.

It ditches the flash player, changes it to an HTML5 `<video>` element, then splits the screen with a scrollable transcript.

##Installation

Right click your bookmarks bar then 'Add Page'. Give it a fancy name then copy the JS from the `pretty.min.js` file, prefixing it with 'javascript:' So, the URL should look like:

`javascript:pasted code here`

##Usage

Load up the video page, then click the bookmark you created above. It will eithr do its magic or indicate that it has derped.

###Eventually

* I'll make this a greasemonkey script to auto-prettify it
* Better regex matching for less errors
* Make the CSS prettier
